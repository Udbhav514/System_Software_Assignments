TASK1

Run the Script:
Ensure you have Python installed. Run the following commands:

    python3 Task1.py

    Input:
        Enter the number of elements to be added.
        Input each element one by one when prompted.
        Enter the final sum.

    Output:

    The script will generate and display possible solutions if they exist. Each solution will be numbered and displayed with the elements, sum, and a line separator.

    If no solution exists, it will display "No solution."

Notes:

    Ensure input contains only capital English letters. The code validates input accordingly.
    The code might take some time to compute solutions due to the exhaustive search through permutations, especially for larger input.
